TODO DOCKER
- Create docker image to be used like so
- Create **deploy button**

TODO DOC
- Document envs, volumes, ports, sqlite as permanent
- Should have a little documentation about reverse proxy and SSL

### For test purpose on localhost

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  tenbeo-auth:
    image: "tenbeo/tenbeo-auth"
    ports:
      - '3000:80'
    volumes: 
      - './data:/root/data'
```

### For production, you have your own reverse proxy

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  tenbeo-auth:
    image: "tenbeo/tenbeo-auth"
    restart: "always"
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    volumes: 
      - './data:/root/data'
    environment:
      TENBEO_AUTH_PINGBACK_URL: "https://tenbeo.your-domain-name.com"
```

### For production, with reverse proxy
