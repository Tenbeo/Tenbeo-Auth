# Tenbeo Admin

### Admin URL

The admin is accessible at `/admin` on your running instance.
This can be changed in `.env` at `TENBEO_AUTH_CLIENT_ADMIN_BASE`.

### Create your first admin user

The admin has a setup page to create your first admin user without having access to your sqlite file.
- To enable this setup page, set `TENBEO_AUTH_ALLOW_SETUP=true` in your `.env`
- Go to `/setup` to create your first admin user

##### How it works
- This page will be disabled automatically after the first admin user is created
- It will enable itself back if you remove the main latest user
- This setting is ready for production, but it is advised to disable it if you have enough admin registered
- A server restart is required if the `.env` file has changed


### Login without the Tenbeo Mobile App

To login without the **Tenbeo Mobile App**, you will need a file access to the sqlite database. This is something you can do on localhost, and is to avoid in production.

1. Create your first admin user with `/setup`
2. Then go to the login page on `/admin`, it will create a session and attach a cookie
3. Open the `data/auth.db` with any sqlite editor ( [DataFlare](https://dataflare.app/) will do it well )
4. Open the `session` column and set `user_id` to `1` and `status` to `VALIDATED` to the latest row
5. You should now be connected locally to the Admin Panel
