### Manual Setup - Deploy with Docker and GitHub on a VPS

Here is an example of GitHub workflow to deploy this application quickly.
It will deploy your freshly installed instance with automatic deployment, and automatic SSL generation.

> You need to have done the manual setup, synced your repo to a **private** GitHub repository. 

Your VPS should have those dependencies :
- OpenSSL / SSH
- Docker 3.0+

Create a new SSL keypair to identify the CI server on the VPS.
Allow the public key on the VPS ( with `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` ).

Copy your `.env` to `.env.main` and configure it for production.

Configure your GitHub repository and set :
- Secrets : private and public keys, on `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` and `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY`.
- Var : `SSH_VPS_HOST` ( can be VPS IP address or its domain name )
- Var : `SSH_VPS_USER` which is the main user authorized for SSH and where application will be deployed.
