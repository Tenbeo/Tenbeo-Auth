### The stack

**Tenbeo Auth** is based on :
- **Fastify** and **Drizzle ORM** on the backend
- **Preact** and **LESS** with **CSS-Modules** for the front-end
- The database is a static **sqlite** file.
- Back and front are compiled with **esbuild**, with watch enabled.

### Clone

The best way is to fork the [official Tenbeo Auth repository](https://github.com/Tenbeo/Tenbeo-Auth.git) and clone this fork locally.

> Do not forget to **merge back from us regularly** and when **critical security patches** are out.

1. Fork in private
2. Clone locally
3. `npm i`
4. `npm npm run server-add-admin-user admin public-key`
5. `npm run dev`
6. Your should see the Tenbeo QR on http://localhost:3000/admin

To pass login locally ( Tenbeo app cannot validate QR on localhost ). Open `data/auth.db` with any SQLite editor, go to the **session table**. You should have a pending session, set `user_id` to 1 ( the user you just added with `server-add-admin-user`, and `status` to `VALIDATED` ). Go back to your browser and you should be logged in.

> Changing any back-end or front-end file will update the state automatically in dev mode.
