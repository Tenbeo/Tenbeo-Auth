# Tenbeo Admin

### Admin URL

The admin is accessible at `/admin` on your running instance.
This can be changed in `.env` at `TENBEO_AUTH_CLIENT_ADMIN_BASE`.

### Create your first admin user

Now that your **Tenbeo Auth Instance** is deployed, or when testing in localhost.
To create your first user, set `TENBEO_AUTH_ALLOW_SETUP` in `.env` :

```dotenv
TENBEO_AUTH_ALLOW_SETUP=true
```

Restart your server if needed, then the `/setup` page will be available to create an admin user.

> [!TIP]
> If any admin is already existing in database, the setup page will be disabled even if this env is correctly defined. This setting can be set on production without security issues. This allows to create the first user without having a file access to sqlite database.


### Login without the Tenbeo Mobile App

To login without the Tenbeo Mobile App, you will need a file access to the sqlite database.

1. Create your first admin user with `/setup`
2. Then go to the login page on `/admin`
3. Open the `data/auth.db` with any sqlite editor ( [DataFlare](https://dataflare.app/) will do it well )
4. Open the `session` column and set `user_id` to `1` and `status` to `VALIDATED`
5. You should now be connected locally to the Admin Panel
