### 4. Create our main admin user

**Tenbeo Auth** has an integrated administration panel to manage **Tenbeo Auth Applications** and **Authorized Users**. Because the admin itself is secured with a **Tenbeo Login**, we need to create our first admin user.

- `npm run server-add-admin-user` and follow instructions to add your first admin user.

> To do it programmatically, for example in a CI / CD pipeline
> `npm run server-add-admin-user $username $publicKey`
